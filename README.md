Java Common Libraries Extensions / Functional Programming Assets
================================================================

Sample implementation how you can use functional programming
in Java prior to Java 1.8.

You should prefer other libraries like guava or op4j for a 
complete set. If you already use Java 1.8 do not even consider
these little helpers as the new features are much more powerful.

This library is kept online as an easy introduction to functional
concepts if you have experience with Java and other object-oriented
languages but are new to functional programming.
